# Take two lists, say for example these two:
#    a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
#    b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements 
# that are common between the lists (without duplicates). 
# Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

# Extras:
# Generate 2 random lists and do the same
